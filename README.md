# Wedding Invite List Planner

A web app that helps brides- and grooms-to-be build their wedding invite list.

The bride would enter her list of friends (sourced from Facebook friends list, for example). The groom has a list as well.

Then, they each choose the friends they want to invite.

The ones they agree on show up in one column, and the ones they need to discuss furhter is in another column.

Clicking "Save" saves their choices for later viewing. Each can "play" with their guest list until all the guests are agreed on.
